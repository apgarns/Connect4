This is a simple implementation of the classic Connect 4 game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Responsive design with a minimum width for the game board.
- Animated disc drop effect.
- Highlighting of the column when hovering over a cell.
- Audio feedback on disc drop.
- Win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections.

## Files
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and inline CSS and JavaScript for the game.
- `click.mp3`: Audio file for the disc drop sound effect.

## Instructions
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to play the game or you can go to https://apgarns.github.io/Connect4/
2. Ensure the `click.mp3` file is in the same directory as the `index.html` file for the audio effect to work.
